# shadcn/ui Skill Assets

This directory is intended to hold any assets that might be used by the shadcn/ui skill, such as:

*   Templates for common page layouts.
*   Example code snippets for complex component combinations.
*   Design tokens or theme configurations.
*   Images or icons that might be referenced in generated code.

These assets are not loaded into Claude's context directly but are available for reference or inclusion in generated output as needed.
